# Experiments with respect to radius client & server

## Idea of the repository
Radius is an excellent protocol but its hard to find all configurations in one place (or
atleast I was not able to find it). Idea of the repositry is to collect and connect all the dots.

## Coverage
* 80211_hw_sim : for simulatoed wan interfaces
* aka_test: For EAP-AKA using hostapd and eapol_test
* freeradius: Related experiments
* Other tests
